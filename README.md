## **Rules**

Staff reserve the right to kick or ban members if necessary to maintain a respectful and enjoyable environment. Warnings will generally be issued first, but serious offenses may result in immediate action.

- **Respect** - Treat all members with respect. Banter is fine, but offensive, hateful, or harassing behavior will not be tolerated.

- **No Deleting Support Messages** - Do not delete your original message after receiving an answer in support channels. This helps others learn from previous discussions and keeps the channel history useful.

- **No Racism, Discrimination, or Political Arguments** - This community is here for gaming, not politics. Racism, discrimination, and political arguments are strictly prohibited.

- **Keep Topics in Their Channels** - Stay on topic in the appropriate channels. If asked to move a discussion, please do so. Memes should stay in #memes.

- **No Spamming or Offensive Language** - Spamming, excessive messaging, and offensive language disrupt the community. Keep it clean and respectful.

- **No Hacks or Cheats** - Discussion of game hacks is forbidden, except for prevention or reporting exploits.

- **Selling and Trading** - This is not a marketplace. We're not responsible for scams or trades. Keep these discussions private.

- **No Advertising** - Do not advertise your server or products in DMs or any channel unless it’s in #servers or #show-off.

- **Malicious Behavior** - Malicious actions, including doxxing, trolling, or trying to harm other players or the community, will result in an immediate ban.

- **No Punishment Evasion** - Users must not avoid punishments. This includes ban evasion, rejoining the server to reset roles, or circumventing disciplinary actions in any way.
